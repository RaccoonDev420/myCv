            <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
            <p>
                As a kid I always looked the explanation for the things that where around me, I always liked to discover new meanings and porpuses for the toys and tools that where at my disposition; Thinking in the posibilitys to solve problems or finding new ways to
                play, it was just an excuse to create something new that I could enjoyed the whole process of make it real.
            </p>

            <p>
                So I decided to share with the world the wonderings of a creative mind that could turn code in amazing solutions for the real world problems, because i frimly belive that the passion for doing what you like and what you want, can take you to a incredible
                places and I'm ready to enjoy the ride.

            </p>

                Now it`s time for me to take a step further to create the new ways of entertaiment of this new generation.
